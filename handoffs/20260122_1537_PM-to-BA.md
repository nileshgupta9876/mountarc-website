## What BA Needs to Do

### Primary Deliverables

#### 1. Create Epics
Break down Phase 1 into high-level epics. Suggested structure:

**Epic 1: Email Infrastructure**
- Set up Resend integration
- Create email templates (6 types)
- Implement email sending API

**Epic 2: Contact Form System**
- Build contact form page (/contact)
- Implement form validation
- Integrate spam protection

**Epic 3: Discovery Call Booking**
- Build booking page (/book-call)
- Create booking form
- Set up notification workflow

**Epic 4: Newsletter Subscription**
- Build footer newsletter form
- Create welcome email automation
- Build unsubscribe page

**Epic 5: Supporting Infrastructure**
- Create thank you page
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up error handling

#### 2. Write Detailed User Stories
For each epic, create user stories following this format:

```
As a [persona],
I want to [action],
So that [benefit/goal].

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

Technical Notes:
- Implementation details
- Dependencies
- Edge cases to consider
```

**Minimum Required**: 20-30 user stories covering all features in PRD

#### 3. Define Acceptance Criteria
Each user story must have:
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format preferred)
- Edge cases documented
- Error scenarios covered
- Success scenarios defined

#### 4. Create User Flows
Document key user journeys:
- Contact form submission flow (happy path + errors)
- Discovery call booking flow
- Newsletter subscription flow
- Unsubscribe flow

Use markdown or diagrams (Mermaid syntax supported).

#### 5. Data Requirements
Document all data collected:
- Contact form data fields
- Discovery call data fields
- Newsletter subscriber data
- Required vs. optional fields
- Validation rules for each field

## Context & Background

### Why This Work Is Needed

**Business Problem**: MountArc's website has broken email/contact functionality, preventing potential clients from reaching the team. Every day without working forms = lost revenue.

**Phase 1 Goal**: Rebuild email and contact system to enable lead capture, discovery call bookings, and newsletter subscriptions.

**Success Criteria**:
- All 3 forms functional (contact, discovery call, newsletter)
- All 6 email types working
- 99%+ form submission success rate
- <5% spam submissions
- Mobile responsive
- Launch by Feb 28, 2026

### Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW)

**Must Have (MVP)**:
- ✅ Email infrastructure (Resend)
- ✅ Contact form (/contact page)
- ✅ Discovery call booking (/book-call page)
- ✅ Newsletter subscription (footer)
- ✅ Thank you page (/thank-you)
- ✅ Unsubscribe page (/unsubscribe)
- ✅ Spam protection (reCAPTCHA v3)
- ✅ Email validation & rate limiting
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness

**Should Have** (If time permits):
- Enhanced error messages
- Better loading states
- More detailed email templates

**Could Have** (Nice to have):
- Email templates with rich HTML
- Advanced spam detection
- Analytics tracking

**Won't Have** (Out of scope):
- CRM integration
- Calendar integration
- Database for form storage
- Admin dashboard

## Open Questions for BA

Please research and document answers:

### 1. Form Validation Details
- [ ] Should we show validation errors immediately or on blur?
- [ ] What specific error messages for each field?
- [ ] How to handle partial form completion (draft save)?

### 2. User Experience
- [ ] Should contact form and discovery call form have different visual treatments?
- [ ] What happens if user submits form multiple times rapidly?
- [ ] How to handle network timeout during submission?

### 3. Edge Cases
- [ ] What if email delivery fails? (Show error or success?)
- [ ] What if reCAPTCHA service is down?
- [ ] How to handle international phone numbers?
- [ ] What if user's email is invalid but passes regex?

### 4. Business Logic
- [ ] Should we validate budget ranges against project types? (e.g., warn if budget seems too low)
- [ ] Should newsletter welcome email be instant or delayed?
- [ ] What happens if user tries to unsubscribe but email not in list?

### 5. Analytics & Tracking
- [ ] What events should we track? (form views, starts, completions, errors)
- [ ] Should we track which fields cause users to abandon forms?
- [ ] Do we need to track spam submission attempts?

This is a **rebuild** project - we're replacing broken functionality with a modern, reliable system. Focus on:

1. **Clarity** - Stories must be unambiguous for Engineering
2. **Completeness** - Cover all features in PRD
3. **Testability** - Acceptance criteria must be verifiable
4. **User-Centric** - Always think from persona perspective

**Remember**: Your stories directly impact Engineering's ability to build the right thing. Take time to be thorough.

**Good luck! Looking forward to seeing the epics and stories.**
